# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch
This repository contains my self implementation of a very popular machine learning model that is Logistic Regression from scartch in Python. I have tried my best to explain how I implemented this in the notebook itself.

I have used the Maximum likelihood Estimation method here using the Newton - Raphsom iterative method to maximize the log likelihood of data. I used a very small random data to train the model and compare with scikit_learn's logistic regression
